- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    Using Class components gives us more methods that come from the Component Lifecycle. But if we remove hooks from the question then I think it comes down to preference. I like writing class components over functional components. There may be a little more code but managing class components seems more understandable. 


- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

        Mounting, this is whats considered the "birth" of the component. Render methods get invoked and componentDidMount gets called. Updating, this is where state is added and can change the data on the screen. Also know as "growth phase". Final is Un-mounting or the "death of the component". This means the component is removed from the page and is no longer visible to the user.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    Custom Hook are basically hooks with added logic or functionality built into them. They can also be import into other components in the same way you'd set up a 'out of the box' react hook.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    Testing our apps allows us to find bugs faster, allows us to "trust the code", makes us think about edge cases, and a few other great perks like encouraging us to write better code.
